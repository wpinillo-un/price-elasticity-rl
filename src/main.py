# Step 1 Defining the state

# [product_id: 'price', 'units_last_7_days', 'category_avg_price', 
# 'category_sales_last_7_days', 'day_of_week', 'month']

# Step 2 Defining the actions

# Define the action_space = ['+', '=', '-']

# Step 3 Defining the reward

# reward = price * units

– Create the Environment

– Define the reward

– Create the agent

– Train and validate the agent

– Deploy the policy

3. Simulated Data
Now, you need to simulate the environment to train the model, especially if you're not deploying in a live environment. You can simulate a pricing environment based on your historical data. Here's how it should look:

Step 1: Simulating Sales Based on Price
For each state (a given day and product's features), you'll use historical sales data to estimate how sales might change with a new price. You can either:

Model the relationship between price and sales (e.g., using historical elasticity models, regression).
Randomly sample from past sales data based on the current state (price, category, etc.).
For example, if product 1 historically sold 30 units at a price of $20, you might simulate that if the agent sets the price to $20 again, it will likely sell around 30 units, though it could vary randomly.

Step 2: Simulate Rewards
For the simulation, you'd calculate rewards after each action based on the sales and price. For each day, after the agent chooses a price:

You simulate the units sold (based on price elasticity or historical data).
You compute the reward (revenue or profit).
Step 3: Simulated Data Example:


Product ID	Date	Action (Price)	Units Sold (Simulated)	Revenue (Reward)	Category Avg Price	Competitor Price	Day of Week
1	2022-01-01	20	30	600	22	19	Monday
1	2022-01-02	21	28	588	22	20	Tuesday
2	2022-01-01	25	50	1250	28	24	Monday
2	2022-01-02	24	45	1080	28	23	Tuesday

4. Transforming Your Historical Data to Train the Model
For training the model, you will:

Extract features from your historical data (like price, sales, category average, etc.).
Generate simulated actions (set prices) for each product based on that data.
Simulate rewards (revenue or profit) from those actions.
Use this data (state-action-reward) to train the reinforcement learning model.
